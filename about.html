        <h3> I’m Celesta </h3>
        <h4>UX/UI designer. Artist. Art Director. Dancer</h4>
        <p>I come from a very arts heavy background. I’m also very keen on 
            technology, organization, and design. I have found that UX design 
            allows me to combine and demonstrate all of my previous training 
            and skill.
        </p>
        <p>Due to my arts background and playful imagination, my work is slightly 
            unorthodox which leads to an innovative and distinctive design. 
        </p>
        <h4>UX Design </h4>
        <p class="h4">Leading with my user-centered mindset , paired with my ability to problem 
            solve and open mind when collaborating with clients, I have found that 
            I excel in user research.
        </p>
        <h4>UI and Development</h4>
        <p class="h4">A dedication to detail, persistence, and thoroughness has proven itself
            exceptionally useful in UI.  I thrive on the, what some may consider,
            tedious tasks such as redlining, prototyping, and developing.
        </p>
        <h4>Art  Direction</h4>
        <p class="h4">Being in various arts fields, I have found myself in leadership roles on 
            many occasions. A strength is being able to visual and execute a project
            from concept to execution.
